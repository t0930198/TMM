214111, wrong escaping in lexer rulesI found a problem with creating custom lexer rules in xText with quote characters in them   xText Native rules are defined as      Native    ID         STRING     The string contains a valid ANTLR 3 lexer rule expression         Since the Native rule body is a STRING lexical token   it must be delimited by single or double quotes   and similar quotes within the token must be escaped with a leading backslash  LRB     RRB    e g    Native FOO               ~  LRB            RRB                  The problem is that when the Antlr lexer rule is generated   the backslashes are not removed   and since Antlr does not have the same escaping rules for quote characters   the resulting Antlr lexer rule will be broken   RULE FOO            ~  LRB            RRB               This effectively means that you can not define custom lexer rules involving single or double quotes   The fix is simply to remove the backslash escape characters before generating the Antlr lexer rule   but it needs to be made to the oAW parser generator   and until then it limits the kind of lexical tokens you can use in your dsl   Cheers   Edwin

214124,  LSB  config  RSB  Need to use doPrivileged when accessing config storeFrom Mike Mansell   I was doing some experimental work with Equinox and the incubator Config Admin service and running under a Security Manager   I found that a bundle that has restricted permissions incorrectly fails when manipulating configuration data   Basically   if Bundle A has only permission to get the ConfigurationAdmin service and CONFIGURE permissions ie    LRB  org osgi framework ServicePermission    org osgi service cm ConfigurationAdmin       GET     RRB   LRB  org osgi service cm ConfigurationPermission            CONFIGURE     RRB  Then   it  s able to get the Configuration object   but when it attempts to update it   there is a permission failure within the Config Admin   Specifically   when it attempts to access the file system to write the updated properties    LRB  ie   java io File access  RRB  the normal AccessController verifies that both the Config Admin AND Bundle A have the permission to access the file   Bundle A  s permissions should have no bearing on this as the fact that it  s a File store is internal to this implementation of the Config Admin

214126, Null Pointer Exception caused by the GraphicalViewerImplThe implementation of registerAccessibleEditPart and unregisterAccessibleEditPart uses the return of getEventDispatcher without checking if it is null or not This cause null pointer exception in some cases   for example is my edit part classes return an accessible edit part and i  m hosting them in a viewer that had no editDomain set on it  LRB  the set edit domain method had not been called on the Viewer instance  RRB    Then we will get a null pointer exception this should be a trivial change to just add the null value check in both methods before calling removeAccessible and putAccessible 
214127, merge AbstractCLanguage and AbstractCPPLanguage into one classComparing the classes AbstractCLanguage and AbstractCPPLanguage shows that they are almost identical   Clearly one is a direct copy paste of the other   Furthermore   the revision history of both files reveals that there has been duplicated maintenance effort   In the interest of code reuse the common elements of both classes should be refactored into a common superclass   
214128,    Generate an annotated servlet class    text appears in all Servlet   Filter and Listener wizardsAll three wizards   Servlet   Filter and Listener   have the option to generate XDoclet annotated class   The code that create the widget group with the checkbox is in the j2ee ui plugin and the text of the checkbox can not be customized by the wizard   Therefore    Generated an annotated servlet class    appears in all three wizards   The text should be change to something more generic like    Generate an XDoclet annotated class

214145, Generic CMDBf Graph Response ViewA generic graph response view is needed   This view will be used as a default view of the COSMOS UI   This view should be able to render the contents of any graph response in a generic way   There should be extension points to customize the specific contents of the graph response   A table is a likely generic view since users at a glance can determine the number of records in the graph response   A table can scale the cmdbf query response better than a tree since the graph response will most likely be root level heavy  LRB  i e  the tree will contain a large number of root notes rather than many leaf nodes  RRB    A tool bar should be provided that provides filtering and searching capability   Searching capability may be complicated   Filtering capability can be the definition of a cmdbf query   Investigation is needed to flatten the cdmbf query response schema to a table view   One idea is to have a details view that shows the xml fragment or a customized view

214153, Data Visualization Customization   Customized CMDBf Query BuilderThe COSMOS UI should provide the ability to create custom filter user interfaces   These interfaces can be in the form of a dialog box or wizard   A strategy is needed to determine how exploiters can contribute their own customized filter user interfaces to the COSMOS ui   Note that these filter user interfaces can be initiated by selecting a menu item   selecting a node   etc    These customized user interfaces will be dojo widgets that are binded using query objects   The above points describe the user interface customization   The last part of this feature involves customizing the CMDBf query   It should be possible to create    CMDBf query templates    that uses some form of macro language to define input parameters for the query   For example   consider the following CDMBf query    registerResponse xmlns= http   cmdbf org schema 1 0 0 datamodel    instanceResponse   instanceId   mdrId  http   testSystem com DiscoveryMdr   mdrId   localId  http   my computer   localId    instanceId   accepted    accepted    instanceResponse    registerResponse  Note that the above CDMBf query has a hard coded localId set to    http   mycomputer      If we use some form of macro language we can create a more dynamic query as follows    registerResponse xmlns= http   cmdbf org schema 1 0 0 datamodel    instanceResponse   instanceId   mdrId  http   testSystem com DiscoveryMdr   mdrId   localId  $ localId   localId    instanceId   accepted    accepted    instanceResponse    registerResponse  The above query defines a $ localId input parameter that a user interface can bind to   The value of the $ localId parameter can be provided by the user interface via a data feed   The following url can be used to execute the data feed   http   localhost 8080 COSMOSUI json service=org eclipse comos dr service handler query template=mytemplate localId=http   my computer note that the template variable signifies the query template file that is defined above   Some investigation is needed to determine the query file registration service   Also note that a macro language is required for this feature   Design note   Should cosmos make use of an opensource macro language processor or make up its own   Apache has a template engine called    Velocity    http   velocity apache org engine index html that can be used   However ip approval is required   If this is an issue we can add extension points to    plug in    a template engine and by default COSMOS can provide a simple template engine that defines simple parameter substitution

214158, Data Visualization Customization   Customized CMDBf ResponseA programming strategy is needed to associate a customized view with a particular graph response   A graph response is a generic structure that represents data from a data manager   Customized data is wrapped inside a graph response that application may want to provided customized view to visualize the data   Lets consider some different types of customized views   1   Creating graph data   The graph can be a pie chart   line chart   bar chart   etc    Determine which chart type to use can be business user specific not data driven   2   Show the data in the tree 3   Show the data in a table 4   Complex widget that is composed of many simple widgets The following are some design issues   1   How can a customized view be associated with a graph response   2   Should the ui customization be data driven or application driven   Application Driven Customization = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Tradionally   the application developer determines the view that will render the data   For example   if a cmdbf query is constructured to return statistical data for a particular web server the application developer may decide to render the statistical data as a line chart   In other cases   the application developer may want to render the data as a table depending on the application context   In this case   a registry service is need to associate a view with a graph query instead of the graph response   Note that the view expects a certain graph response format that is dictated by the graph query   The above mechanism requires a datafeed that accepts a graph query id and returns a graph response that tags the response with the graph query id   The graph query id will be used to lookup the registered view assoicated with the graph query   Data Driven Customization = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = In this case the data recieved from a CMDBf graph response will determine the view to render the graph response   Does data driven customization useful   Need to understand uses cases that would make this useful   In this case   a registry service is need to associate a view with a graph response instead of a graph query 
214159, consume library dependencies from OrbitThe libraries that are currently distributed in the web core plug in these should be consumed as Orbit bundles instead   This will require changes to the build process and developers need to check out the corresponding bundles into their workspace

214224,  LSB  UML  RSB  Ignore visibility of features in supertypes1  1 Release build A compliance point of the OCL specification suggests that implementations should ignore declared visibilities of namespace members when resolving references   The UML binding attempts   to a large extent   to do this   However   for attribute and operation look up   its reliance on the Classifier     getAllOperations  LRB   RRB  and Classifier     getAllAttributes  LRB   RRB  API results in look ups failing to find private features of supertypes   The cause is in the Classifier     inherit  LRB   RRB  operation   which does not make private features of general classifiers available as members of the inheriting classifier   The MDT OCL implementation should work around this   to    inherit    private features   This is particularly of value for client applications that previously used this OCL implementation for UML by adapting UML to Ecore   which does not have a visibility concept   and have since picked up the UML support in the 1 1 release

214412, Create an independent feature for ICU4J plug inBuild ID   3 4 Steps To Reproduce   ICU4J plug in is currently a part of org eclipse rcp feature   ICU team often provides data updates for time zone rule   which were distributed via the Eclipse software update site as feature patches   Each patch is supposed to work with any maintenance releases within a same Eclipse feature code stream   But   each of them requires corresponding RCP feature ID   For example   Eclipse 3 3 includes ICU4J plug in 3 6 1   A same patch works well for ICU4J plug in included in Eclipse 3 3   3 3 1   3 3 1 1   But the patch must have the exact target feature ID   thus   it requires 3 different installable patch features including the same contents for them   In general   fixes in ICU4J plug in is independent from RCP feature   For now   we  LRB  ICU team  RRB  only provides tzdata updates   but we may want to release other type of patches in future   This bug report proposes to separate ICU from RCP feature in Eclipse 3 4 and beyond   so it makes us  LRB  ICU team  RRB  to maintain the ICU plug ins independent from RCP releases   More information

214436, Deselection Events in Trees TablesCreated attachment 86274 Video  LRB  XVid  RRB  that demonstrates the issue Hi there   Currently using SWT 3 3 and having an issue with the selection events in SWT Trees and Tables   specifically that there does n t seem to be any intuitive way to discern between Selection and Deselection   and that there is no event generation for items that are implicitly deselected via the selection of another item   A selection event is posted when an Item is clicked on by the User   thereby selecting it   the same event is posted when the User then Ctrl Clicks the same Item   thereby deselecting it   nothing in the event object indicates any difference between the two events   although they are quite different events   The above instance can be solved by retrieving the selection from the Tree  LRB  or Table  RRB  and checking whether the item is contained in the selection or not   The issue becomes more complicated in multi selection able Trees and Tables   if Item 1 was selected a selection event is posted   if Item 2 is then selected another selection event is posted for Item 2   but no Event will have been thrown if the previously selected Item 1 was deselected in the process   so whether the User disregarded the previous selection by simply clicking on Item 2 or whether he expanded the selection by Ctrl Clicking on Item 2 is not inferable from the Event Object   Therefore   it becomes necessary to store the previous selection of the Tree or Table and to then compare it to the new selection   a process that becomes very frustrating to nigh impossible once 3rd party classes programmatically update the Tree or Table selection   since there are no events thrown when a Widget is updated programmatically and we are no longer allowed to sub class the Tree or Table classes   which could have been useful if we wanted to intercept method calls  LRB  setSelection in this case  RRB    In addition it now becomes necessary to hook the Dispose Event on the Items that we are storing in our    previous selection    holder   in order that we do n t inadvertently assume deselection for items that were removed   All in all a very complicated process for something that should be   in my opinion   a bit flip in the statemask field of the Event Object   E g  imagine that you have a diagrammatic view of objects that are shown in a hierarchic fashion on our tree   imagine that if the User clicked on an object in the tree the corresponding object in the diagram view is also selected  LRB  highlighted  RRB  and vice versa   If we had selected three items in our tree   the appropriate three items in the diagram will light up   but when the user clicks on the fourth item   the view would have to check whether those previous three items were deselected in the process   it would have to keep a storage array of the previous tree selection and everytime it receives a selection event from the tree  LRB  it would be a selection listener of course  RRB  it would have to check the new selection against the previous selection   When we add more views to the mix   this becomes hard to manage   since these other views can update the selection of the tree programmatically for which no events are generated   And since these extra Views are pluggable and dynamic   one has to keep the array that stores the previous selection of the tree as a resource shared between Views and have to add an extra rule to the programming of these Views   All of this just because no deselection events are generated for Items that are implicitly deselected   If a Selection Event was thrown for every item that was deselected   with something in the Event to indicate selection or deselection   this whole process becomes a lot easier   Alternatively   if it is felt that we  d be running the risk of generating too many events   a single Selection Event can be thrown   but then some mechanism would be required to obtain the list of items that were implicitly deselected by the selection of the new item   Thank you in advance   Lodewijk Pool

214519, Allow appending strings to CREATE TABLE statements  LRB  Allow MySQL engine = InnoDB  RRB  It would be useful to allow SQL to be appended to the end of CREATE TABLE statements   One use for this is as follows   By default   MySQL 5 installs with a non transactional engine as the default engine on Unix servers   When this engine is enabled   database transactions do not work for tables that are created with default syntax   Tables that are transactional can be created by appending    engine = InnoDB    to the end of the CREATE TABLE statement   e g  CREATE TABLE MyTable  LRB  id INTEGER  RRB  engine = InnoDB This functionality would be useful to anyone that wanted to make use of transactions on a MySQL server they could not control and could potentially allow other similar features to be used on other databases   Because this feature does not currently exist   we are forced to require any MySQL database we run our testing on to have InnoDB as the default engine   This potentially causes problems in a community such as Eclipse because the EclipseLink group will not necessarily be able to own the servers testing is running on

Aniszczyk Austin IBM IBMUS Date   01 07 2008 11 59 PM Subject   PDE API tools and ASM bytecode manipulation framework Hi everyone   Chris Aniszczyk mentioned another day that PDE API tools are using ASM framework   Since I am one of the developers of ASM   I thought it would be useful to share my thoughts and comments about PDE usage of ASM as well as few questions that could help me to get better understanding of your implementation and use cases   My observations are more or less random and mostly based on a quick scanning trough ASM API calls and do n t assume deep analysis of the PDE implementation   Please do n t take those notes as criticism   those simply suggestions for better usage of the ASM API that could help to improve performance and memory usage for your application   I think it is really great application for ASM library and I am very excited about it   First of all I see that PDE API tools is using    asm    and    asm tree    jars   However    asm tree    jar is usually used for complex in memory class transformations and method analysis   which does n t seem the case for PDE API tools   I found two uses of the    tree    classes and they both can be removed   org eclipse pde api tools internal comparator TypeDescriptor and org eclipse pde api tools internal search ClassFileVisitor Basically those classes are making inefficient use of ClassNode   where it can be replaced either with org objectweb asm commons EmptyVisitor from    asm commons    jar or your own dummy implementation of all ASM  s visitor interfaces   like the org eclipse pde api tools internal util ClassVisitorAdapter you have   That would improve processing performance and eliminate unnecessary memory allocation   If I understood TypeDescriptor initialize  LRB   RRB  method correctly   it is not interested in the method code   so you could use classReader accept  LRB  visitor   ClassReader SKIP   CODE  RRB    to completely skip all methods code from visiting   Same applies to implementation of SearchEngine getExtraction  LRB       RRB  and TagScanner Visitor getMethods  LRB       RRB  methods   where you also can add ClassReader SKIP   CODE to avoid visiting method code   There is a feature in ASM that allows to skip unneeded methods and other class artifacts   So you can return a null from visitMethod  LRB   RRB  call   then method code will be also skipped  LRB  that also happens when you visit an abstract or native method  RRB    For example   in Converter MyClassFileAdapter visitMethod  LRB   RRB  you could rewrite the following code   MethodVisitor visitor = super visitMethod  LRB  accessFlags   methodName   desc   signature   exceptions  RRB    if  LRB  visitor   = null  RRB   LCB  if  LRB  reportRefs  RRB   LCB  visitor = new MyMethodAdapter  LRB  visitor  RRB     RCB  else  LCB  visitor = new ClearCodeAttributeMethodAdapter  LRB  visitor  RRB     RCB   RCB  return visitor   like this   MethodVisitor visitor = super visitMethod  LRB  accessFlags   methodName   desc   signature   exceptions  RRB    if  LRB  visitor   = null  RRB   LCB  if  LRB  reportRefs  RRB   LCB  visitor = new MyMethodAdapter  LRB  visitor  RRB     RCB  else  LCB  visitor visitEnd  LRB   RRB        for safety visitor = null    RCB   RCB  return visitor   The above essentially eliminating ClearCodeAttributeMethodAdapter   which should probably have been implementing MethodVisitor directly instead of extending MethodAdapter   or org objectweb asm commons EmptyVisitor should have been used instead of it   If none of your visitors actually cares about StackMap information   you may as well add ClassReader SKIP   FRAMES flag to ClassReader accept  LRB       RRB  call when reading or transforming classes   It is better to not extend ClassAdapter when visitor does n t do any transformations and it is used only to collect data   like ClassFileDescriptorBuilder does   I would suggest to use something like EmptyVisitor for that   Though it is worth to mention that org objectweb asm commons EmptyVisitor is flattening the visiting events   i e  it do n t make difference between method and fields annotations   but you can return new instance of the EmptyVisitor subclass if you need to keep hierarchy   Also   code in ClassFileDescriptorBuilder visitMethod  LRB   RRB  that extracts value for default annotation look fairly similar to the code in org objectweb asm util TraceAnnotationVisitor class from ASM  s    asm util    jar   but your version does n t seem add separator between array entries   In ClassFileVisitor visitMethod  LRB       RRB  method   The following code   switch  LRB  type getSort  LRB   RRB   RRB   LCB  case Type LONG   case Type DOUBLE   argumentcount + = 2   default   argumentcount + +    RCB  can be replaced with   argumentcount + = type getSize  LRB   RRB    The state machine used in Converter MyMethodAdapter  LRB  passing stringLiteral between visitLdcInsn  LRB   RRB  and visitMethodInsn  LRB   RRB  methods  RRB  is probably going to work for classes compiled by javac or JDT   but there could be legal bytecode that wo n t fit into that pattern   but I am not sure what is the implication of that for PDE API tools   I think I understand what MyMethodAdapter does about reference types  LRB  which seem very neat idea  RRB    but I  d be interested to learn why you have special processing for ASTORE   IRETURN   RETURN   ATHROW and POP opcodes and not all INVOKE   opcodes   In Converter MyClassFileAdapter visit  LRB       RRB  it is better to use Opcodes V1   5 instead of magic number    49      Though I wonder why you need to use that version instead of version from the original class   In the same method   it might be better to use annotation instead of custom attribute   Annotations are usually easier to access  LRB  in the bytecode as well as trough reflectio API  RRB  and you can still store them into classes with version   49   Though that is obviously matter of personal preferences   I also curious what Converter MyMethodWriter is used for   I do n t see any use of collected lastOffset value   Hope you would find these notes somehow useful   Please let me know if I could be at any help in regards to ASM framework and thanks again for using it

214660, Setting delegate for proxy resolving containment not created properly 
214661, VM managed Entity detachmentAllowing a Persistence Context to reference managed objects in a weak manner would provide Rich Clients an automatic memory management mechanism   Currently JPA clients must manage memory foot print manually by controlling the lifetime of the PersistenceContext as well as the contents of the Persistence Context   Within a Rich Client environment it is much easier for application developers to simply use the managed objects as the UI backing objects and leverage transparent persistence instead of creating a DOA layer   Currently the only limitation with this approach is memory management   Persistence Contexts tend to grow and detaching objects is problematic   With this feature memory management can be delegated to the VMs garbage collection functionality through the use of weak references   End users must be aware of certain side effects of unpredictable detachment from the Persistence Context but as long as developers are aware of the limitations the feature should provide the needed functionality

214829, improve rendering of the related tasks in the task editorThis issue somehow related to Bugzilla and JIRA connectors as well to other connectors that could have dependent tasks   Currently rendering of dependent tasks is quite different between Bugzilla and JIRA   The former is using two row with text entry fields on first row and hardcoded hyperlinks on a second row   It all looks like a legacy inherited from the Bugzilla web UI limitations   In JIRA   there is much more variants of the linked tasks and due to the complications with the JIRA API connector does n t allow to edit these links   but to render them it is using single TextViewer and also taking advantage of JIRA hyperlink detector   So linked tasks are taking less space comparing to Bugzilla connector   It would be useful to unify rendering of the linked tasks and improve their rendering in Bugzilla Task Editor to use less screen real estate

214915, Concrete context modelA concrete context model is needed to solve some of our current model problems such as lack of extensibility and expandability   and complexity maintainability   This will require a large refactoring that will affect both the model and UI code   The current Dali model will be broken into two distinct models   one being the resource model and one being the context model   The resource model will be responsible for modeling and managing the physical XML and Java JPA artifacts   The XML resource model will use the EMF XML Translators to read and write the XML artifacts   The Java Resource model will use the Dali Annotation Framework to read and write Java annotations via the AST   This separate resource model is necessary primarily due to the limitations of the EMF XML Translation framework   which can compromise an object model depending on the physical XML structure that it manages   The context model will represent the JPA meta data   abstracted from the physical file and file management constraints mentioned above   There will be an XML context model and a Java context model which implement common interfaces   The UI will need to be updated to use these interfaces where they have changed   Since we are also removing EMF from the Context model   the UI will need to be changed to use a different update mechanism

214966,  LSB  api tooling  RSB  search more selectively for API usage problemsThe builder for API usage problems previoulsy extracted all reference information from a component   then resolved all references to determine if there were any usage problems   I modified the process to first collect all API restrictions in prerequisite components and then search for references to those specific elements conditions   This appears to speed up the search   and will allow us to add support for  noreference into the builder

214968, Plug in Registry view should preserve selection when removing filterI meant to enter a bug for this a while ago and then forgot   When you use the filtering functionality in the Plug in Registry view to find an element   you typically want to explore its context to find out more   Example   after entering    Outline    to find the extension for the Outline view   you might want to know the view  s id   One way to do this would be to select the matching node and then removing the filter text   Unfortunately   the selection in the tree is lost when you do that

214973, Connection profile extension point should not require an icon for the connection profile elementThe connection profile element of the connectionProfile extension point requires a graphic and since it is usually defined in a non ui plug in and it is undesirable to require the non ui plug in to provide a graphic file   the extension should be changed so that the graphic can be provided separately   Note   Once this defect has been fixed the jdbc 16   gif file that is shared from the org eclipse datatools connectivity plug in should be removed   
214974,  LSB  Workbench  RSB  Allow Workbench UI state to save restore to user provided Input Output StreamsPresently   all of the methods in Workbench that are involved in saving and restoring the workbench UI state are private   This means that a developer of an application based on the RCP can not override the location where the state is kept   It would be very nice to be able to save and restore the UI state in a database so that clients could see the same screen layout even when using an application based on the RCP from different computers

214980, Preview Extension PointThe ability to pass Scriptable objects to a BIRT report is one of its best features   Unfortunately   there is no good way to model this behavior from within the designer   The idea is that you create an extension point where you get access to either the engineConfig or more likely the Task that is used to run the report prior to the report running   It is possible just providing access to the the AppConfig would be enough   In any case   within the plug in you could instantiate and add the Scriptable object at preview time   Jason   are there other reasons to be able to get access to the Engine Task that is used to run a report prior to the report running in the designer environment

215007, Widget notifyListeners  LRB  int   Event  RRB  should catch runtime Exceptions when looping through the listenersBuild ID   M20070921 1145 Steps To Reproduce   1   Put a couple of listeners  LRB  any kind  RRB  on a widget 2   One of the listeners throws an arbitrary RuntimeException  LRB  eg   NPE  RRB  3   listeners subsequently called in the loop  LRB  EventTable  RRB  are not called   More information   The listener calls not being safeguarded has also severe consequences for any caller of Display readAndDispatch  LRB   RRB  since the listeners RuntimeException travels outside without being wrapped in a SWTException   If a runtime exception is happening in a runnable running a Display syncExec or Display asyncExec it comes wrapped in a SWTException   Therefore callers of Display readAndDispatch  LRB   RRB  might not expect that they must catch RuntimeExceptions as well which leads to undesired and hard to track problems   as Display readAndDispatch  LRB   RRB  is mainly used when multi threading is involved   We had this problem when setting up for UI tests   Since the PDE JUnit tests are run in the UI thread we have to fork out to a separate tests with an own test suite in order to not block the test run with modal dialogs being opened   Our test suite forks the test run into a separate test  LRB  from the UI thread  RRB  and issues then a Display readAndDispatch  LRB   RRB  loop until a flag indicates the test run being finished   The  LRB  expected  RRB  SWTException had been caught in the waiting loop but not a RuntimeExcpetion which might easily be propagated through from a listener   This lead to a premature death of the WorkbenchTestable thread and the IDE subsequently not being shut down   which caused severe problems in test run nightly   Also the bug was very hard to find since  LRB  as the RuntimeException was not caught and or logged in the loop  RRB  it was not apparent that the Exception led to premature end of the waiting loop   I think the following behaviour would be desired   1   Catching any RuntimeException from listeners for each individually while looping through the listeners   2   Wrap the caught exception into a SWTException  LRB  like it is done for Runnables in a Display syncExec  RRB  and throw after ALL listeners are being notified   This also prevents the UI from undesired behaviour if one of the players in the game is playing false

215036, Migrate to the Eclipse NLS system for the Babel editorCreated attachment 86678 patch to migrate to NLS Currently the Babel editor uses a messages bundle relying on the    normal    architecture to get Strings   Eclipse uses an other way to handle messages   by subclassing the NLS class and declaring static Strings   Attached is a patch that transforms the Babel editor to rely on the Eclipse NLS system   It changes the structure of the fragment a lot   the nl folder is removed   to place the French properties in the same package as the default properties   I am an Eclipse committer over the STP project   as such I hope this contribution will not raise IP issues
