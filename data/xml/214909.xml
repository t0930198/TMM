    <thetext>It would be nice for Linux distributions if we could get a source drop of the SDK without the pre-generated build.xml files (see [1] for some background).  In order for that to be useful, though, we&apos;ll need to bootstrap PDE Build so that it can be used to generate the build.xml files for us.  I&apos;m envisioning something like:

1) decompress source drop which doesn&apos;t have build.xml (and other generated) files
2) build PDE Build with just ant
3) use bootstrap PDE Build to generate PDE Build&apos;s build.xml
4) build PDE Build using the generated build.xml
5) use PDE Build to generate the rest of the build.xml files
6) build the SDK

DJ, does this make sense or am I way off base here?  Do you have any suggestions for how to proceed?

    <thetext>Note that (2) is more than just pde.build, you basically need to bootstrap the equivalent of the basebuilder.  This is something like 16 bundles or so. 
This might not be all that bad if you accept pre-generated build scripts for this part (like the current source builds, but simpler since it isn&apos;t the entire eclipse).

Or, if you can accept using pre-built binaries for the basebuilder, and maybe just build the pde.build, then is much simpler.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yeah, I realized that after looking at a generated build.xml for PDE Build :)  I think pre-generated build scripts for that part are perfectly okay.  Much better than pre-built binaries.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yeah this seems like a good direction. I remember when I first started putting together the build for p2 I was trying to get a minimal builder but it ended up bringing a lot of things in which was unfortunate so I think pre-generated build scripts for at least that part is the way to go.</thetext>

    <thetext>Alex is working on this as part of his eclipse-build project.  It is mostly working and we&apos;re going to include the eclipse-build stuff as part of our 0.3 release in July if it can produce a working Eclipse SDK.</thetext>

    <thetext>See revision 22560 and earlier in eclipse-build.  We include pre-generated build.xml files for PDE Build and its dependencies and use them to bootstrap the build.  We then use the bootstrapped PDE Build &amp; friends much like basebuilder is used by others.</thetext>

&gt; See revision 22560 and earlier in eclipse-build.  We include pre-generated

&gt; 

In general, you would only really want to do this for major milestones/releases where you can believe that the pde.build you&apos;re bootstrapping is stable enough to actually perform the entire build.</thetext>

Understood.  I don&apos;t imagine we&apos;ll be doing it more than major releases.

Thanks again for the help, Andrew!</thetext>
