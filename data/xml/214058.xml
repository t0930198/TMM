    <thetext>Build ID: I20070625-1500

Steps To Reproduce:
I call full build. While workspace is building, I copy a file to my project. Dialog show message: waiting for building workspace. After finish building workspace but Resource changed listener doesn&apos;t fire my build



More information:
Similar to Java build. When full build happen (I changed JRE version (1.4 -&gt; 1.5) to force full build). While workspace is building, copy a Java file into workspace. Dialog show message: waiting for building workspace. But after finish building workspace, file which just copied doesn&apos;t build. (Although Clean action work perfectly, my Java file is built after build workspace)</thetext>

    <thetext>From the sound of it, the issue may lie in the builder framework.  If not and it is in an implementation, please let me know.</thetext>

    <thetext>Make sure that the &quot;During auto builds&quot; option for your builder is checked and &quot;Build Automatically&quot; is on. I did some investigation using the latest N-build.

Steps:
1) I created a project with a custom program builder
2) in the build options for the builder, the options &quot;During auto builds&quot; &amp; &quot;After a Clean&quot; are checked
3) I reproduced your steps with copying a file during a build
4) the custom builder was triggered twice, first during the full build, then during  the auto-build (when the file is copied)

I managed to reproduce your issue only when auto-build was not triggered at all. For instance if the only checked option in &quot;Run the builder:&quot; section is &quot;During auto builds&quot;, the auto-build is not triggered. For me this is related to the already existing issue, see bug 108534.
