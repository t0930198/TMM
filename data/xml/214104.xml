    <thetext>I&apos;m using Eclipse 3.2 and have recently downloaded the latest version
of the JFace data binding framework from CVS. Upon compilation, I got
a single compilation error in the class ObservableListContentProvider
on line 50, where the method AbstractListViewer#insert(Object,int) is
invoked which, however, is not present in Eclipse 3.2.
According to the CVS history, this method call was introduced as part
of the fix for bug
    https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=198603
Previously, the method AbstractListViewer#add(Object) had been used
instead (which exists in Eclipse 3.2).

As I think that backward-compatibility to Eclipse 3.2 is still one of the
goals of the JFace data binding framework, this may be regarded to be a bug.</thetext>

&gt; As I think that backward-compatibility to Eclipse 3.2 is still one of the
&gt; goals of the JFace data binding framework, this may be regarded to be a bug.

To make it easier for early adopters, we decided to be compatible with the previous release of JFace and SWT. The goal for 3.4 is that data binding will work with SWT and JFace 3.3, but not 3.2. Can you not use the released version of data binding if you are targeting 3.2?

&gt; [...] Can you not use the released version
&gt; of data binding if you are targeting 3.2?
I don&apos;t want to use the provisional JDB API which ships with Eclipse 3.2 as it differs quite a bit from the current API but I think that the version of JDB with the CVS tag &quot;R3_1_1&quot; is perfectly fine for me as it is still compatible to Eclipse 3.2. Beside that, it&apos;s obvious that the HEAD revision can not stay compatible to Eclipse 3.2 forever :). In any case, thanks a lot for the immediate feedback on the bug report, Boris!</thetext>

Sorry, I should have made myself clearer. I wanted to suggest that you use data binding from the 3.3 (Europa) release. It should be possible to use that with Eclipse SDK 3.2 (Callisto). You might have to recompile it though - see http://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace_Data_Binding_FAQ#Can_JFace_Data_Binding_run_against_Eclipse_3.2.x.3F or bug 177476.</thetext>

Thanks for the clarification, Boris! That worked just fine :).</thetext>
