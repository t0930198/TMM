    <thetext>I am running windows xp x64, 64bit. (Recently upgraded from a long time using regular 32bit windows) I&apos;m using a standard 3.1 release of Eclipse SDK, which is 32bit I believe. I used this same version in 32bit windows, and transferred over when I upgraded. And, for the most part, functions properly.

The problem is, I&apos;ll have 5-10 files open, and minimize the whole eclipse application. When I bring it back up, the scroll bars are gone, but only the last document I was looking at. They appear for all other 4-9 files, but not the one that was being displayed last. I can close the file and reopen, and the scroll bars re-appear. 

It is not file or language specific, as I tested the java, html, php(phpeclipse) plug-ins.</thetext>

    <thetext>This was recently fixed in the 3.4 stream, and is under consideration for 3.3.2.

The problem happens as a result of another running app adding Windows hooks that make the widget hierarchies in eclipse become too deep.  So you may be able to make eclipse 3.1 work if you can identify which running app is doing this.  A couple that have been identified as doing this include SetPoint and Hydravision.

    <thetext>I&apos;ll do the upgrade, no biggy. Thanks.


However, to provide more information, which might help others, the applications I run all the time are:

Trillan messenger (32bit)
Ultramon x64(most likly the culprit)
Nvidia Ntune x64 (possible too)
Firefox (32bit)
IE (32 &amp; 64)
Flash FXP ftp app (32bit)


Thats pretty much it.</thetext>

    <thetext>Oh I also run &quot;synergy&quot;, which is a 32 bit program, for connecting multiple computers (win/linux/mac) to one KB/mouse. Could also be the culprit</thetext>
