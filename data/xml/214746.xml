    <thetext>[Trace Project] Create Bugzilla component for trace reports.

The following plug-ins and feature are not in a Bugzilla component:

Plugins:
org.eclipse.tptp.trace.report.birt
org.eclipse.tptp.trace.report.birt.ui
org.eclipse.tptp.trace.report.birt.doc.user

Feature: 
org.eclipse.tptp.trace.report.birt

We should create a component (Trace.UI.Reporting) in Bugzilla to support these plug-ins and feature in past and future releases.

NOTE: This new component should be added to the TPTP Project Matrix:

    <thetext>before we do this, there seems to once again be confusion over what is platform
and what is not. 

There are at least two issues being noted in this series of similar defects.

1 it is being asserted that the &quot;product&quot; in bugzilla is closely correlated to
the  &quot;project&quot; in TPTP. This is not the case or the intent. The product is
simply a filter criteria created to make it easier for an end user to locate
the component of interest.

2 the component name in bugzilla redundantly reflects the project it is part
of. This is done to avoid duplicate names when opening defects and to ease
sorting. It is a correct reflection of the component and the project it is a
part of and as noted above is not correlated to the product name in bugzilla

3 components that are used or expected to be used or depended on by more than
one other project in TPTP are defined to be in the platform project. For
example many trace views are used by the performance and monitoring projects so
are in the platform. This implies that the function is common, even though it
may be considered to be a prime function of one project over another. The trace
model is in fact intended to be common for all projects.

There may be a few components that in hind sight do not need to be in platform,
but these need to be considered one by one with the future in mind.</thetext>

    <thetext>Harm, do I understand you correctly what you suggested to make Component name more  sensible for end users, who do not worried about internal project structure.
If so what we can use? Probably in this case we can add them in  &quot;(Platform.UI.Reporting)&quot;.

    <thetext>Bottom line for required changes.

New component should be added.

&gt; 

The Platform.UI.Reporting component contains the common BIRT report integration, which each subproject contributing report wizards and report types/templates in their &lt;project name&gt;.UI.Reporting component.</thetext>
