    <thetext>Build ID:  M20071023-1652

Steps To Reproduce:
1. download Eclipse 3.3.1.1 
2. open the Profile Dialog
3. select a java application 
4. wait a few seconds and eclipse will abort


More information:
This issue also occurs with Eclipse 3.3.0

I used a Java project that I downloaded from an eclipse tutorial web page called Product Sample; but, it seems to fail no matter what Java project I select.</thetext>

    <thetext>A couple questsions:
- Which version of Java, and which OS are you using?
- Also, what do you mean by &apos;aborts&apos;? Do you get an error message from eclipse before it closes, or does the process just die with no warning?</thetext>

    <thetext>I am using MS Windows XP with SP2, and I only have one JRE installed -- it is 1.6.0_01

When it aborts, Eclipse just goes away with no error message or dialog.  I looked around for a log file, but as near as I could tell there where files with recent entries in any of the obvious locations.</thetext>

    <thetext>Excellent, just one more thing: Can you confirm that the directory that you have Eclipse installed in contains a space? (for instance,&apos;C:\Program Files\Eclipse&apos;)</thetext>

    <thetext>It does contain a space.</thetext>

    <thetext>And it no longer dies without the space in the directory path.
