    <thetext>Build ID: Version: 3.4.0 I20071213-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
Simple steps for lose info:
- In the Java project wizard, Enter a project name and hit &quot;Next&quot; (accepting all default values)
- On page two, in the Source tab, right-click on the &quot;src&quot; folder and select &quot;Remove from Build Path&quot;.
- Click &quot;Back&quot;
- Click &quot;Next&quot;
===&gt; The src folder is on the build path again.

Simple steps for add third page (not suggesting this is a valid thing to do since the class is internal):
- subclass internal class JavaProjectWizard
- use:
    @Override
    public void addPages ()
    {
        super.addPages ();

        // Add the third page.
//        pageThree = new MyPageThree ();
//        addPage (pageThree);
    }
- try to access project from third page code.
===&gt; when navigating to the third page, the project isn&apos;t there any more.

I would like to add a third page to the dialog in order to customize the Java project which was created, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be possible.

More information:
These are both symptoms of the fact that the project is deleted when calling NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo.setVisible(false).</thetext>

    <thetext>Agree that it is uncommon to reset the page when &apos;Back&apos; is clicked - all other wizards don&apos;t do this. However, it has been like that since day one in the new project wizard. Martin, to decide whether to close as WONTFIX.

This report contains two bugs. Please don&apos;t report two problems in one bug in the future. You can&apos;t add a third page into the existing wizard but you can create your own wizard and use the API classes (see NewJavaProjectWizardPage for a start).</thetext>

    <thetext>Sorry about entering two problems here -- internally my thought process was that the bug was that setVisible(false) removes the project.

What I am trying to say about creating a new Wizard using the new API classes is that actually this doesn&apos;t work if you want to add a third page.  Since NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo.setVisible(false) removes the project (ie. the project is deleted when you navigate away from the second page), any settings which are set on this page are lost when navigating away from this page -- either back to page one or to a new page three.  So these new API classes only work if the user uses page one, then page two, then finishes.

I also forgot to mention that this was related to Bug 160985 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=160985 -- really an enhancement).

    <thetext>Maybe it would be more correct to allow the user to go back to the first page and come back without resetting the changes. But only when the user does not make any changes on the first page.
However, this is quite tricky to implement. I&apos;d prefer to keep it how it is currently. Note that bug 214693 has been fixed.
It should be possible for implementors by overriding &apos;setVisible&apos; to have it their own way. &apos;createProvisonalProject&apos; and &apos;removeProvisonalProject&apos; are now API as well.</thetext>
