    <thetext>The refresh connection manager on the shape compartment editpart determines whether a connection, one of the ends of which is inside the shape compartment, needs to be clipped or not. Connection is clipped if its source and/or target anchor point is clipped. Therefore connection refresh manager needs to know the anchor points coordinates for a connection.

Problem.
Anchor points are calculated manually, although the connection has been laid out already and anchor points could be just read directly from the connection without any calculations. Clipped or not visible connections need to be routed, however, to determine whether they still need to be clipped. This issue leads to showing connections that need really be clipped and vice versa.</thetext>
