Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a resource
2. Set some persistent properties on the resource
3. Delete it using the UI
4. Undo the delete, the persistent properties will no longer be on the resource


More information:
It&apos;s clear from looking at the code that this is not implemented.  The solution is probably to add the properties information to the AbstractResourceDescriptor such that when the resource is recreated it can include the properties.

Note that I would expect the properties to be preserved because for example the IResource.copy() does copy the properties with the resource.

This is important for me because I use the properties to store object type information which is used to determine the icon, label and editor.

I would be happy to work on a patch for this; I would extend the AbstractResourceDescriptor.  If there is better way to do this, please let me know.</thetext>

    <thetext>In 3.4 we might have to implement this in org.eclipse.ltk.internal.core.refactoring.resource.undostates.AbstractResourceUndoState since the default delete is the LTK delete.

    <thetext>This was intentionally unimplemented until there was a specific/compelling use case to do so.  The thought was that property info could be recomputed if it was not there.

Marking this as a duplicate, but you can reopen the original if you disagree with the logic there.
