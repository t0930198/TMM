    <thetext>Hi,

currently it is possible to give views their own window by dragging them outside the main window. It seems that this is done by eventually creating a new StandaloneView. If this was instead a new PageLayout we could use this second window as a fully featured workbench with its own layout in the confines of that second window. In a dual screen configuration this would be just awesome ....

Hope someone of you likes the idea.

bye M;chi</thetext>

    <thetext>You can do this now by opening a new window and setting it up how you like.</thetext>

    <thetext>Well,

actually I can&apos;t. What I _can_ do infact is opening a new window and placing one or more views into that window. But that&apos;s not what I mean. This external window does not provide its own layout so as a consequence I _can&apos;t_ place my views freely on that window pane. What I want is to be able to have multiple active (as in &quot;side-by-side&quot;) views under the regime of that second window.
Or am I missing something here - might well be?

Thanks Tod, anyway</thetext>

Michael, you&apos;re not missing anything...;-). See bug 151510, we&apos;ve been looking into this but I complicated the issue by introducing the new min/max behavior (which we&apos;d now have to support in the &apos;Detached&apos; window...
