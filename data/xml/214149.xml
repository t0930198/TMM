    <thetext>The era of 3.0 plug-ins will come to in an end in 3.4

It&apos;s a bit of a burden on PDE to support these cases and the functionality should be removed. It would simplify a lot of the logic around plug-in creation and manifest validation.</thetext>

    <thetext>Have we identified any functions that would take more time to implement based on backwards support?  My two cents is that as long as we don&apos;t have to do much maintenance on the code we can give the benefit of the doubt to the users.  Once we have to do additional work to support 3.0, we should drop it.</thetext>

    <thetext>Chris,

Were you proposing to merely drop the tooling support for 3.0 plugin &apos;creation&apos; and to retain tooling (and runtime) support for other areas, (for example by removing the &quot;3.0&quot; option from the wizard) or were you thinking of something more radical?

    <thetext>I&apos;m mainly focusing on creation right now. I want to remove the ability to create 3.0 style projects.

That&apos;s a good and easy start.</thetext>

    <thetext>Brian,

I think I agree to an extent, but from the perspective of someone new coming into PDE as a potential contributor, the less there is to learn, the easier it will be. Consider the earlier discussions we&apos;ve had on the plugin vs bundle models within the PDE codebase. 

It certainly seems sensible to me to be looking to fully drop support for the &apos;legacy&apos; plugin format at a major release, especially if it&apos;s well publicised to the Eclipse community - as well as a little nudge from the PDE team with this enhancement, plus possibly the adding of a deprecation style warning message - configurable within the PDE/Compilers pref of course ;-)</thetext>

    <thetext>This is as Wassim would say &quot;a slippery slope&quot;.  But I am +1 for removing the ability to create 3.0 projects.</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;m not against this but wonder what improvement there is in simply removing the 3.0 choice from the version list in the new project wizard.  3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 (and preherpas 3.4) are still in the list.  The user is no more or less confused.  The point I was subtly making in comment 2 was that there should be some gain for the loss of function.  Smaller?  simpler?  faster? more stable?  easier?  Doesn&apos;t really have to matter what the gain is but when someone says &quot;why can&apos;t I use 3.4 to create/edit 3.0 plugins&quot; an answer of &quot;because by removing that capability we were able to cut the size/space/... of PDE by X% (whatever)&quot; is way better than, &quot;we are not required to support development that far back&quot;</thetext>

    <thetext>this will give us an opportunity to remove the plug-in converter (that Tom hates) and some supporting classes in the org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.converter package.</thetext>

    <thetext>great, you guys get to remove the converter but we have to keep it in Equinox.  I&apos;m jealous</thetext>

    <thetext>We decided that the PluginConverter will remain due to the ability of moving old projects to new style projects. We disabled the ability to create 3.0 style projects though.</thetext>
