    <thetext>Build ID: I20071213-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Setup a repository with a pre-commit hook that can fail (ours check code formatting)
2. Commit something that makes the hook fail (return -1) and write something to stderr
3. Witness the lack of any error messages as to why the checkin failed. Or even any notification at all that it did!

More information:
As written in short form in the &quot;Steps to reproduce&quot; field we have implemented a pre-commit hook to check our code formatting. And as far as I can tell Subversive simply refuses to show me anything useful when this pre-commit fails.

The hook is, as per the Subversion documentation, implemented so it returns &apos;-1&apos; as status code when commits are not accepted. And any errors are written on stderr. This work as expected with the command line client and a co-worker tried this in Subclipse and it also showed the  error correctly.

But in Subversive I am simply getting a normal commit log in the console view. It even ends with &quot;*** Ok (took 00:02.771)&quot;. But the line before says &quot;Committed revision -1&quot; instead of showing the revision number as usually happens. Un the up-side it seems that at least Subversive understands that the commit didn&apos;t actually work. So Eclipse still show the file as being changed in relation to Subversion.

I am using the SVNKit (1.1.4)  connector but am unaware if any other connector works correctly. As I have none other to check on Mac OS X (AFAIK). And my Subversive is 0.7.0.v20071221.</thetext>
