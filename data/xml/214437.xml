Mark, with this feature (and the tweak in your ItemProviderAdapters) your big model should be faster now. Can you please tell me if you are content or if there is further need to optimize?</thetext>

Eike,

I can&apos;t say that it appears any different.

I deleted the old database, and re-imported my data. Then I rebuilt both the client and server side with most recent CVS source.

Startup seems a bit faster, but access to objects is still very slow.

Mark.

That should at least eliminate the effect of bug #215686. Can I close that one?

Hmm, here it is really fast.
What db adapter are you using?
Have you configured a connection pooling datasource?
can you send me the client logs again to verify that reference-chunking is really turned on?</thetext>

Eike,

Yes you should close #215686.

I am using mysql.

No, I have not configured connection pooling datasource, unless that is default.

I post logs soon as I can.

    <thetext>I&apos;ve circumvented so far to implement own connection pooling because I belived that most &quot;real&quot; DB vendors have data sources that do this already. Nevertheless I&apos;ll try to do it for the cases where the data source can&apos;t do it. See bug #216586.

BTW. my UI with your model is very fast. If your UI with your model is slow it could also be a problem with your UI? It would be good to test your model with the shipped CDO UI as well.</thetext>
