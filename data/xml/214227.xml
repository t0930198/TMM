&gt; 

I don&apos;t think you mean remove from CVS. I think you mean remove from the build and  no longer propagate to any new branches.

BTW, these components should not be removed from the project matrix as they are still real and supported for previous releases for several years to come.</thetext>

No, I meant remove.  The plug-in is obsolete since the function has been integrated into the org.eclipse.tptp.test.report.birt plug-in.  It will still remain in past branches.

&gt; BTW, these components should not be removed from the project matrix as they are
&gt; still real and supported for previous releases for several years to come.

The matrix is now generated for each release (see http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/matrix/matrix_archive.html).  Changing the current and future matrices will not impact the matrix for previous releases.

&gt; 

I think as long as it is downloadable, it should have an owner, even if there is no support. At least so someone can say there is no support and answer a question if someone happens to offer to provide support.

    <thetext>Agreed.  However, we are only removing a plug-in that is being removed from CVS.  All of the BIRT report function will be in CVS and the matrix.</thetext>

&gt; No, I meant remove.  The plug-in is obsolete since the function has been

&gt; remain in past branches.

To clarify, we are only removing the contents of this plug-in and not the complete from CVS. 

Joel: Please only remove the contents of the following plug-in in CVS:
org.eclipse.tptp.test.report.birt.ui
