    <thetext>Build ID: 3.4  I20071213-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a 3.0 plugin
2. From the overview tab of plugin.xml editor select &quot;create an OSGi bundle manifest&quot;.
3. Select the &quot;plugin.xml&quot; tab and the eclipse version is still 3.0.

Wouldn&apos;t it be correct expect this to have been updated to eclipse version=3.2 ?

    <thetext>Actually, it is working as designed.  Let me explain more after I get into the office :)</thetext>

    <thetext>When converting a plugin.xml to a Mainfest.MF, we look at the Eclipse version
you currently have in your target platform.  We do this, because different
headers (like Eclipse-AutoStart, Eclipse-LazyStart, etc) have been deprecated
in different versions of Eclipse.  Therefore, we look at the target platform to
figure out which headers are valid based on the assumption you wish to run the
project against your current target platform.

One could make the case we should upgrade the eclipse version in the plugin.xml
accordingly.  I just checked with the man in charge of the specifications
(Oleg) and he told me we currently support both specifications and at this
point does not foresee dropping support for the 3.0 version.  Therefore, if we
leave it as 3.0 then we can continue to run it in Eclipse 3.0 and future
releases without problems.  This just gives the user the most flexibility while
maintaining a supported specification version.

I do have to admit I had a much quicker reply until I started thinking about
this version and had to ask around to see if we should be updating it to 3.2. 
Good question, it was definitely something I had not thought about.</thetext>
