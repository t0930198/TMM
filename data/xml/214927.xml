    <thetext>It would be really helpfull, if the environment variables of the serviceconfig.xml would be visible to the agents as well. This would eliminate the need to specify absolute paths for classpath etc.

Example (from agent.xml):

variable %TPTP_AC_HOME% defined in serviceconfig.xml

&lt;LaunchConfiguration&gt;                                
  &lt;launchInfo&gt;
    &lt;Application executable=&quot;java.exe&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Variable name=&quot;AGENT_NAME&quot; position=&quot;replace&quot; value=&quot;sample.MyAgent&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;Variable name=&quot;AGENT_HOME&quot; position=&quot;replace&quot;  
                value=&quot;%TPTP_AC_HOME%/agents/%AGENT_NAME%&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;Parameter value=&quot; -Djava.library.path=.&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;Parameter value=&quot; -classpath %AGENT_HOME%/lib/myagent.lib.jar&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;Parameter value=&quot; sample.MyAgent&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/Application&gt;
  &lt;/launchInfo&gt;
&lt;/LaunchConfiguration&gt;

Another possibility would be to define a set of properties in the serviceconfig.xml that are visible to the agents using placeholders. The values of these properties could be set directly or using the environment variables of the serviceconfig.xml

The advantage of using the environment variables lies at hand, since the agent configuration does not have to be modified to match the install location.

If exposing the environment variables to the agents is the orginally extend, then it seems not to be working ;)</thetext>

    <thetext>As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As such, TPTP is not delivering enhancements. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement is resolved as WONTFIX.
