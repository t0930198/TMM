    <thetext>With the current layout managers, that are provided by SWT, some things are really  unhandy to code. Unhandy in the sense of generating bloated code.
The situation intensifies as there is no good GUI builder available for Eclipse Europe.
On the other side, there is currently a top 25 enhancement request at Sun to include MigLayout (the Swing part only) to JDK 7.
As MigLayout (www.miglayout.com) also supports SWT it would be nice to have it in SWT as well. MigLayout is under the BSD license.
If you don&apos;t know it, then please give it a try, or look at a little example (picture + code) I set up on my page (http://www.medicalgenomics.org/miglayout_sample).
As you&apos;ll see, the code is good readable and comparatively short.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1

I usually lean against integration of third-party stuff into SWT.  However, in this particular case, I would be in favor of it.  MiGLayout is absolutely tremendous, and could even be the basis for a far more powerful VE plugin.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1 BUT, wouldn&apos;t it be preferable to replace text-based configuration with a class? Even in Kai&apos;s simple example you&apos;d need to remember format and keywords for:

&quot;[right]10[left, grow]&quot;
&quot;growx, wrap&quot;
&quot;width 100!, split&quot;
&quot;gapleft 10, wrap&quot;

Not to mention that some of that is rather cryptic (e.g. what does exclamation mark means? Negation? Fixed size? If so, what kind of size it is without it?). I know I can read documentation, I&apos;m just trying to tell that it&apos;s not obvious.

To make it more compact it could be a chained operation, e.g.

label.setLayoutData(new MIGLayoutData().setLeftGap(10).setWrap());

This way compiler can check at least for syntax validity of such configuration statement (and we all like when we know about errors sooner than later, don&apos;t we? :))

    <thetext>Max,

Thank you for your support.

Luckily I have already added exactly that type of API you are looking for. Look in the Swing demo at the last two examples.

You can write code that looks like:

new MigLayout(new LC().fill().wrap().width(&quot;200&quot;));

Same type of API works for column/row and component constraints.

Cheers,
Mikael</thetext>

I like the textual configuration. With this feature it is very simple to create dynamic UI&apos;s where the configuration of the components can be loaded from the server side as an example.

    <thetext>Excellent add-on to Java.  This is the one layout manager that should replace all the other Java layout Managers.  I have saved so much time with using Miglayout, I highly recommend it to all Java developers.  Now if we can just get an IDE that creates Java GUI&apos;s that work better than Jigloo or JFormDesigner, and use Miglayout my headaches would almost be gone.</thetext>

    <thetext>Any news on this RFE? I joked on IRC today that I&apos;ll probably join the Church of MigLayout ;) But seriously, this is excellent layout and recently I started to use it for basically everything because of its flexibility and minimal amount of configuration needed to get the job done. Can we expect it to be integrated into SWT anytime soon?

And I second Mikael&apos;s question: why this bug is not on main bugzilla page? With 39 votes it should be #1 RFE (current #1 RFE which is bug #241476 has only 14 votes).</thetext>

I think this is because Eclipse moved this to the Nebula project where unofficial enhancements to SWT live.  MigLayout is a great layout manager, but I doubt it will ever become part of official SWT (as much as we all wish it was!).

    <thetext>I cannot speak for the SWT or Nebula teams, but shouldn&apos;t this bug have an attachment with the source code of MiGLayout, together with a statement from the author that he is contributing this to Eclipse, and willing to change its license to the EPL (or dual-license it under EPL and something else)?

Without this, it cannot even be considered for inclusion in Nebula, which would be the appropriate place for it in the Eclipse project structure.</thetext>

I am definitely willing to dual license it under EPL (as well as BSD).

    <thetext>Hi Mikael,

Nebula is currently changing it&apos;s internal structure (every widget will eventually get a subproject on its own) and maybe we need to move out of technology and find another place for Nebula (Platform would be a natural choice IMHO) because we can&apos;t do 1.0 releases inside Technology. Boris do you think this makes sense?

I&apos;ll try to write a draft proposal Nebula-Component-Contributors can use to propose their Component to Nebula/Eclipse. I&apos;m taking ownership of this bug and ping you as soon as I have the draft but I&apos;d also invite you to subscribe to nebula-dev-mailing list.

This makes a lot of sense to me. Do you know if a project in incubation can have subprojects that are no longer incubating?</thetext>

    <thetext>Boris one can&apos;t do a 1.0 release while in incubation. This is why we are splitting Nebula into subproject then every sub-project on itsown can decide whether they are in incubation, doing a release (only a project can do a release which would mean nowadays that Nebula only can do a 1.0, 1.0.1, ... which will never happen). 

I&apos;m just working on a little RCP-Application which should support contributors creating (Nebula-)Component-Proposal =&gt; Creating the Review Documents, ... .</thetext>

    <thetext>There is a high interest to bring this Widget to Eclipse and I&apos;m accepting contributions. 

The problem I&apos;m seeing in moving the code to Nebula is that MigLayout is not only for SWT but also for Swing and I myself already thought about porting it to QT(Jambi). So there&apos;s a mismatch between Nebula and this contribution. 

I&apos;m not sure where an appropriate place for such a layout would be. The only place currently dealing with multi widget toolkit support is UFaceKit [1] which supports various widget technologies from SWT over Swing to QT(Jambi) and we are already using Mig-Layout in our internal implementations.

Any other ideas?

Another thing I&apos;m not sure about is whether it is possible to dual license code coming from Eclipse.

    <thetext>Hello Tom,

Just to be clear, MigLayout supports both Swing and SWT (and JavaFX) but this is through different code bases. There is a separate .jar for the different widget frameworks. So, I think that you should maybe only include the SWT part. About 90% of the code if common for all ports of course, but that shouldn&apos;t mean that the SWT version is &quot;polluted&quot; by Swing and JavaFX and vice versa.

When it comes to licensing I am very flexible and can release MigLayout under any license you want. I am very pragmatic and just want this layout manager to be used as much as possible.

Porting it to Qt sounds very interesting. Let me now if you need something from me to make this easier.

Cheers,
Mikael</thetext>

    <thetext>Hi Mikael,

Do I get this right you don&apos;t have a common base but when fixing a problem in the common stuff you fix it twice (once in the SWT-Code base and once in the Swing-Code base).

Could you please provide me with a link to your source-code-repository to check out the code and take a look.</thetext>

    <thetext>Tom,

I don&apos;t have to fix it twice furtunately. Internally I have all sources (except the JavaFX port which is hosted by Dean Iverson) in one repo. But the SWT and Swing specific code is held in different packages. The common package, which is the layout engine (the 90%), is totally widget platform independent. So if you want a pure SWT version is very easy to get.

The two packages you want is:

net.miginfocom.layout.*  (no widget references, just two proxy interfaces)
net.miginfocom.swt.*     (three SWT impl. classes)

I have the SVN repo on an internal server ATM. Since I guess you&apos;ll be hosting this in some other repo would it be OK if you just got the source from the source.jar?

If you are going to add MigLayout I guess we should discuss how to formalize the process for when I fix a bug in it so that you can get that change in a good and orderly way.

Cheers,
Mikael</thetext>

I did try to OSGi-enable my Mave build script without success.

I can attache the sources, no problem, but is that enough? I mean the sources is in a Maven repo, isn&apos;t it better to pull them from there since then you&apos;ll get updates? I don&apos;t know anything about the Eclipse world unfortunately so you&apos;ll have to tell me what&apos;s the most efficient way forward.

&gt; Isn&apos;t WONTFIX a rather strange resolution when one is effectively talking about
&gt; FIXED?

From a nebula-dev PoV it is a WONTFIX because we are not going to host this component in our repo. The first dev builds are ready http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/committers/drops/I20091124014054/ but I haven&apos;t tested them yet.</thetext>
