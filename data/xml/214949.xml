    <thetext>This bug is to capture the discussion on the proposal to launch the JavaServer Faces (JSF) Facelets Tools project as an incubator project under the WTP-JSF Tools project. 

Facelets, https://facelets.dev.java.net/,  is a performing and popular JSF view handler that uses XHTML syntax to define a JSF page. The objective of this incubating project is to enable the current set of features in the JSF Tools project to support Facelets. Since Facelets is not part of the current JSF specification, this work is being done as an incubating project.

The detailed proposal for the project is attached to the bug for review.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Raghu, I think this will be very interesting, though may ambitiously &quot;drive down&quot; requirements into the XHTML editor! 

One thing you should change in your proposal right away, is your use of the word &quot;release&quot;. Such as you say, &quot;First stable release will be available by July, 2008&quot;. 

What ever that is in July, will not be a _release_. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard me (and others) rant about mis-use of the word &quot;release&quot; in Eclipse. In Eclipse, it has a very specific, highly technical definition that means it&apos;s been through the various hurdles thrown up at projects by the Foundation and the Community, and that it is &quot;ready for commercial products&quot;. And that&apos;s not going to happen by July! December maybe, but I&apos;d prefer it be in our next yearly release cycle, to be in WTP 4.0, in June 2009. 

We need to find a term we can all use, that suits what you are describing. I suspect you mean basically a milestone, but more than a milestone too. Perhaps adding some qualifiers related to &quot;delivery&quot; and &quot;recommended&quot; would work? Such as &quot;recommended milestone delivery&quot; or &quot;recommended deliverable&quot; or something like that ... which we can then clearly define how we&apos;d like, and not have to use one of the Eclipse Foundation&apos;s &quot;reserved words&quot;. 

BTW, Eclipse is the only open source group to have this problem ... Apache does too and a few years ago, they had to make an effort to get people to stop using the word in context&apos;s such as &quot;that bug is fixed in the xx/yy build so you can use that release to fix your problem&quot; (when that build was just some interim build ... not yet released! ... hence inviting disaster in terms of misunderstandings, expected compatibility, support, etc. 

Thanks again, looks like good work to me. I hope some others from the community with decide to join the effort. Thanks for getting it going.

&gt; 

How about &quot;Technology Preview&quot; instead of &quot;release&quot;? We used this phrase to describe jsf 0.5 &quot;release&quot;.</thetext>

&gt; 

Perhaps. It&apos;d be better to work in the word &apos;incubating&apos; and/or &apos;milestone&apos;, perhaps 
&quot;Technology Preview Milestone&quot;?

    <thetext>I believe we can mark this as fixed, right? And further bugs/enhancements would be separate.
