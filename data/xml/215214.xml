    <thetext>Build ID: I20070621-1340

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Use Eclipse on a Windows-PC and sources which are located on a remote Unix host
2. Put the remote sources into an Eclipse project using a linked folder
3. The remote sources contain file system elements, which differ only in character case
4. Only one of these elements is visible within Eclipse


More information:
I work at a WinXP-PC with Eclipse locally installed.
My Eclipse workspace is stored locally on my PC, too.
The workspace consists of three projects:
1. (Main project) A complexe system written in Pascal, C, C++ and Java with more than 55,000 files.
   This project and the source files are managed by a ClearCase server, which is hosted by a Unix server and connected via a Samba share.
2. The C/C++ standard headers
   This project is stored locally on my PC in the workspace directory and contains a linked folder. This folder is linked to my build host, which is a Unix server, also connected via a Samba share, but which is different from the ClearCase host.
3. The Boost C++ libraries
   The project is structured analogeous to project 2.


The problem I observe is the following:

Due to the Unix distribution of our build host, the standard headers (project 2) contain among others the following directories:
/opt/SUNWspro/WS6U2/include/ &gt; ll
drwxr-xr-x   CC
drwxr-xr-x   CC4
drwxr-xr-x   CCios
drwxr-xr-x   cc
drwxr-xr-x   f77
drwxr-xr-x   f90
drwxr-xr-x   lint

The directory CC/ is not visible within Eclipse, but hidden by the directory cc/. 

I&apos;ve put the directory /opt/SUNWspro/WS6U2/ as a linked folder into my project.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, this is a general problem that case sensitivity is determined by the local OS.</thetext>

&gt; I thought we had a bug report for this already, but couldn&apos;t find one.

Hm, it&apos;s now quite a long time ago since I reported this bug. Can I hope for a solution?</thetext>

Bug 39488 is the one John was looking for. We don&apos;t plan to work on this during 3.6.</thetext>
