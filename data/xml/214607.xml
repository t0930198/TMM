More information:
5 days ago, eclipse was working fine, but suddenly it started not to accept such key bindings.
I tried to solve the problem by myself but I could not solve it.
I formatted the OS(Win XP), download new version of eclipse (3.3.1.1), and tried almost everyting.
In fact, this problem occurs also in eclipse 3.2, but when I tried eclipse 3.1, the key bindings are working fine.

I am using jdk 1.5.0_08-b03.

In addition, I am using Toshiba Tetra A8 notebook.</thetext>

    <thetext>I assume you verified that NumLock isn&apos;t enabled.

Try with a fresh workspace. Does it work there?
Try in the normal text editor (context menu &gt; Open With &gt; Text Editor)

This looks like a configuration or hardware issue on your side.</thetext>

    <thetext>Hi Daniel,
I accidentally solved the problem,
I forgot my notebook mouse at the office, and when I arrive my house, i used my personel mouse. And surprisingly noticed that, the problem is gone.

But, interesting point is, only eclipse 3.3 caused such problems, all the other software installed on my PC is working fine.

So, thank you for your interest.

    <thetext>In addition, as you ointed out in your comment, I tried a fresh workspace, tried with num_lock on\off case, etc.

When i tried the text editor in eclipse, not java editor, it also did not work for this case.

    <thetext>In the state where it&apos;s broken, do the keys work in other Eclipse views (e.g. using Up/Down or PageUp/Down in the Package Explorer)?</thetext>
