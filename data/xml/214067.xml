    <thetext>Happy New Year Webmasters!

I&apos;d like to propose to re-enable indexing of Eclipse.org Bugzilla through Google. From a comment on a similar BMO Bugzilla bug it seems that there is a way to make Google indexing less intrusive for a Bugzilla cluster.

For reference:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305744#c8

--- Comment #8 from [XXX]  2008-01-01 21:07:12 PST ---
I hear bugzilla 3.0 is faster so this performance is no longer such an issue.

[YYY], would you be so kind as to do an experiment?

1. reassign this bug to yourself
2. use the Google Webmaster Tools at https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools to
reduce Google&apos;s crawl speed on b.m.o to &quot;Slow&quot;
3. add the following to the top of http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/robots.txt:
     User-agent: Googlebot
     Allow: /
4. see if:
     a) the mozilla community is overall happier now that b.m.o is indexed 
        by Google (darn useful), or
     b) unhappier because b.m.o is just a tiny bit more loaded.
5. if the truth is b), then undo step 4.</thetext>

    <thetext>Happy New Year to you too!

We used to allow Google to index Bugzilla, but their indexer is fairly aggressive, and despite contacting them to slow down, they didn&apos;t, and this had a small but noticeable impact on Bugzilla&apos;s performance -- mostly during peak usage.

When committers complain to me that Bugzilla is slow, I need to trim the fat from somewhere. Disallowing Google to index was a huge piece of it.

Also, this ties into bug 102963.  If Google can index our site, then it&apos;s much easier to harvest email addresses without ever coming to eclipse.org.

FWIW, I&apos;m all for allowing Google to index Bugs.  But right now my back is against a wall.</thetext>

    <thetext>It is not ready yet, but a very skilled colleague of mine is working on a spider and an indexing engine to index one of our websites.

If that would benefit Eclipse, we could make it available to the webmasters team.

We could discuss that during EclipseCon, by that time it should be more mature.</thetext>

Denis, &quot;if we ever re-enable&quot; is stripping hope away from me. What would make you consider reindexing with this setting ? Why wouldn&apos;t you try now, or at some point in the future ? (how about letting that on during the Christmas break, and cut it out if it is a nuisance when the load increases in January ?)

    <thetext>That&apos;s frustrating and backwards (although not your fault), because as http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html explains, that is just a panacea:

&gt; There are two important considerations when using /robots.txt:
&gt;
&gt;     * robots can ignore your /robots.txt. Especially malware
&gt; robots that scan the web for security vulnerabilities, and
&gt; email address harvesters used by spammers will pay no attention.
&gt;     * the /robots.txt file is a publicly available file. Anyone
&gt; can see what sections of your server you don&apos;t want robots to use.
&gt; 
&gt; So don&apos;t try to use /robots.txt to hide information. 

So the fact is, we are using robots.txt not to actually hide the emails, but only to make people *think* we are hiding the emails, and thus spare you lots of angry emails :-)  Again, it isn&apos;t your fault that people don&apos;t realize how this all works; but we are giving up Google indexing without actually preventing people from getting spam.</thetext>

Small sample of show processlist

Yeah, we make do with what we&apos;ve got.  Actually, new features in the upcoming Bugzilla 3.2 will likely make it less painful for us to allow spiders.

One of the biggest performance concerns with Bugzilla now is that, when our slave DB has &gt;120 seconds of lag, we switch all Bugzilla queries to the master for maximum accuracy.  However, when people run huge searches while on the master, the MyISAM tables can lock as a result of an incoming change.  See the small subset of SHOW PROCESSLIST (attached).  We get this regularly if the slave DB lags.  Note that in this case, we had about 275 queries waiting for more than 30 seconds for the DB.  If Google, MSN and crew were allowed to index, we&apos;d approach/exceed our connection limit of 1500, thus killing all out db-driven sites.

We have monitor scripts that terminate long-ish queries, but killing a query that&apos;s running is annoying to users.

The related fixes (in Bugzilla 3.2) are here:

    <thetext>RedHat just recently added the ability to allow google to index bugzilla.  They have a very good outline of the pros and cons, many of which have been mentioned here.   In the end, they found a way to generate a SiteMap that google&apos;s crawler uses to index the site.

There are numerous advantegous to having google or other search engines index the bugs.  In fact, with out Red Hat allowing google to index, I wouldn&apos;t have found their solution, which we can possibly reuse:

    <thetext>FWIW, I&apos;m experimenting with Bugzilla indexing in CloudFree using Mylyn. It&apos;s far from being perfect. The index needs more love to return better relevancy. There also seems to be an issue with missing bugs. I haven&apos;t had time yet to investigate why.

    <thetext>I suggest we create a small program that copies the bugzilla content to a flat HTML website. Each bug can be stored in a separate html file with a link pointing to the actual bug. We can easily strip email addresses from each file and let google index that content.

In my opinion, then everybody is happy. We have the content in google, no e-mail addresses are indexed and the bugzilla is not burdened by a google agent sucking all performance out of the website.

    <thetext>Dave&apos;s solution looks best to me. Copying the whole bugzilla and stripping its html from the email addresses is very expensive as it would be a custom solution we would have to maintain ourselves and would have an impact on performance as well.

I thin the report says it all...it&apos;s missing bugs, and the index needs to be me more accurate.   Personally, I&apos;d still go for the way Red Hat has implemented it.  Seems to work fairly well for them.

Oh that&apos;s fixed. It just did fetch all the bugs in the beginning. The index may need more relevancy tuning but it&apos;s typically better than Bugzilla&apos;s full text simple search feature.

    <thetext>I agree. It is a great tool but bugzilla needs to be indexed by search engines. 

Antoine was quick to throw my idea in the Recycle Bin but I still think it will solve all the issues. (comment #16)

Custom made program: Yes sure, but it is a trivial program. I would say about 20 lines of PHP code and a clever regex to strip the e-mail address.

Impact on the server: Absolutely minimal because a bug is written out only when it changes. The google can index the flat file html on a lower bandwith server. 

Any other opinions?</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #23)
&gt; Any other opinions?

Personally, I don&apos;t like it at all.  Maintaining a huge library of flat files is a nightmare (we do this for all the newsgroup pages, download pages, etc and it&apos;s not a set-and-forget process by any means).  Additionally if we have to move things around in the future, thus invalidating links, we face the requirement of rebuilding the entire library of flat files.  

Additionally, I see lots of usability problems with maintaining a flat file archive of bugs.  

As for RedHat&apos;s solution, I don&apos;t see how it helps us solve the problem we initially had with Google et al crawling the bugs.  Here is the clincher for me, quoted from that bug Dave linked:

&quot;* The sitemap standard doesn&apos;t have a (widely accepted) way to define crawl
delays or other means of giving the crawled system a break in terms of the load
it generates&quot;

So, since that was our objection to begin with, I don&apos;t see how this helps us.

What problem are we trying to solve exactly?  Initially I think we were trying to make it easier to search for bugs, something that Gunnar&apos;s code does quite well.  The idea would be to make that code a community effort (Gunnar is willing to do that) so that we can improve it ourselves (this means you) if we see better ways to enhance the bugs search.  It has already a number of features that Google can&apos;t match in terms of specificity of the *bugs* search.

On the other hand if the problem you are trying to solve is more &quot;public&quot; visibility of bugs, then Google does provide an advantage there over Gunnar&apos;s solution.  Personally I seem some utility to that but frankly my experience with bug searches via Google in the past has been pretty negative.  You often find related bugs that contain your error message but the solution is unrelated to your problem.  I&apos;d rather promote a proper search engine for Eclipse bugs that will show people all of the related bugs at Eclipse in a simple list.

&gt; What problem are we trying to solve exactly?  

The problem is that we want the bugs to be searchable from google. Gunnar&apos;s search is excellent but that is not what we are talking about. 

I propose to file a bug with the request to replace the link to bugzilla&apos;s search engine with Gunnar&apos;s search engine. Gunnar, do you agree? 

Can we make bugzilla reachable from google search. The problem is harvesting of e-mail adresses, and the load google imposes on bugzilla when indexing.

A solution is to offload the data to another server and remove the e-mail addresses in the process and let google index that. Can somebody who is in charge of bugzilla give the green light for an experiment or say WONTFIX.

&gt; Personally I seem some utility to that but frankly my experience
&gt; with bug searches via Google in the past has been pretty negative.  You often
&gt; find related bugs that contain your error message but the solution is unrelated
&gt; to your problem.
That doesn&apos;t reflect my own experience at all, I was able to find some very tricky solutions through Google from error messages.</thetext>

    <thetext>We made some performance enhancements to Bugzilla 3.4 (partially based on the work that Red Had did) that should allow Google to more safely index a Bugzilla. I&apos;d be interested to know if this makes things better for Eclipse. (All you should have to do is add &quot;Allow: show_bug.cgi&quot; to your robots.txt, after you upgrade.) If things are favorable for a lot of large installations, then future versions (possibly even future 3.4 point releases) will enable Google indexing by default.</thetext>

    <thetext>bugs.eclipse.org seems to run Bugzilla 3.4 already, was the &quot;Allow: show_bug.cgi&quot; thing already tried?

From my understanding, Bugzilla has to generate a sitemap with last changed dates to allow Google to access the pages without causing too much traffic. http://bugs.eclipse.org/sitemap.xml doesn&apos;t seem to exist though. Does anybody know how this is supposed to work? (otherwise, I&apos;d try to figure this out, because resolving this bug would make bugs.eclipse.org a lot more usable).

Another thing which might help regarding cpu load is to allow Google/users to access the bug reports via http instead of https.</thetext>

    <thetext>I *think* you should be able to allow Google to index Bugzilla without having to have a sitemap--a sitemap would just help guide Google to all the show_bug links.</thetext>

    <thetext>But how does crawlers find their way to bug pages if only &quot;Allow: show_bug.cgi&quot; is allowed? You need some incoming links from a list page or site map, imho.

Also, a sitemap would be a very clever thing to have: one of the main concerns in the comments was load on the bugzilla machine - a sitemap can contain a lastmod date and therefore help with avoiding unnecessary requests by crawlers - might help to tell them when something changes if you have 100k+ pages, doesn&apos;t it? ( http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php ). Besides that, fixed bugs could be given a lower crawling changefreq and priority.</thetext>

  There are plenty of links to show_bug.cgi around the web, and enough links from one bug to another to have the most important bugs show up in Google.</thetext>

    <thetext>There are two blockers to this bug -- one of them is performance, which is taken care of.  We&apos;re running mod_perl and we have big database servers, so I&apos;m not too worried.

The problem now is the fact that Bugzilla exposes email addresses. Despite the light mangling and the warning on the create account page, I still get the typical nastygram when someone Googles their email address and get tons of Eclipse Bugzilla hits.</thetext>

  Bugzilla 3.4 does not, to logged-out users.

&gt; Despite the
&gt; light mangling and the warning on the create account page, I still get the
&gt; typical nastygram when someone Googles their email address and get tons of
&gt; Eclipse Bugzilla hits.

  That&apos;s really, really stupid, since spam bots aren&apos;t exactly going to be respecting robots.txt--all that Google is doing is showing them that their email address is indeed accessible on the Internet.</thetext>

Yeah, that&apos;s for sure, but I really care about the most rare and seldom bugs to show up in Google. That kind of bug that only 1 other person in the whole world encountered - besides me. :)

Where are they exposed? When I&apos;m not logged in, I don&apos;t see any e-mail address. Also, I wouldn&apos;t put a lot of trust on bots considering the robot directives.</thetext>

Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t seem to be indexing very much.  I tried something a little more specific.

site:bugs.eclipse.org xpath2

And should have gotten a lot of results.  Instead I only pick up 2 results, compared to the local bugzilla search.</thetext>

Yeah, I&apos;ll give it a shot later in the week.  Depending on how the indexing goes, it may also need a generated SiteMap to help google know how to crawl the pages.</thetext>

    <thetext>Denis, thanks for fixing this issue. Unfortunately, search for bug reports is only useful when crawlers can find and index all bug reports, especially new ones which are not linked from other bugs. I filed an enhancement request to add the sitemap, there is an existing script that does exactly that:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=298359

(for example, this bug 298359 about the missing sitemap is not indexed since december because the sitemap is missing :)</thetext>
